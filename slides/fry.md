# Ben Fry's Process

 * Acquire - get the raw data
 * Parse - provide meaningful structure to the data
 * Filter - isolate interesting parts of the data
 * Mine - apply statistics or data mining
 * Represent - choose a visual representation
 * Refine - iterate to improve the visual representation
 * Interact - add interactions to the visual representation
