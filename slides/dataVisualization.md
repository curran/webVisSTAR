# Data Visualization

<blockquote>Computer-based visualization systems provide visual representations of datasets intended to help people carry out some task more effectively.</blockquote>

 * Harness visual perception for data analysis tasks
 * Type of data dictates visual encoding possibilities
 * The "best" visualization depends on the data and task
