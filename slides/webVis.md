# Visualization with Web Graphics

 * Tons of supporting libraries
 * For conventional charts, consider [HighCharts](http://www.highcharts.com/) or [NVD3](http://nvd3.org/)
 * If the task involves a map, consider [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/)
 * For more complex and interactive visualizations, consider [D3](http://d3js.org/)
 * [D3 Example](examples/ide.html#d3)
 * For 3D visualization, consider [Three](http://threejs.org/)
 * For interactive filtering, consider [Crossfilter](http://square.github.io/crossfilter/)
 * Challenges: using these tools with visualization theory and "big data"
